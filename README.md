# Prediction-of-Sales-using-Linear-Regression
Linear Regression is a Machine Learning Algorithm that is used to predict the results.

Prediction of Sales using Simple and Multiple Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression are the sub parts of Linear Regression.
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm. It predicts the result value based on the previous training data.

Simple Linear Regression is a part of Linear Regression and in this algorithm the results can be predicted based on single independent data.

Multiple Linear Regression, in this, we can predict the exact value based on multiple independent  data values.

In this project we will generate the Sales values using only one data value that is TV (simple Linear Regression).
and also using multiple data values that are TV, Radio, Newspaper (Multiple Linear Regression).
